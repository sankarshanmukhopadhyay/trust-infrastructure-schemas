# Changelog

## v0.15.0 - 2026-08-30

### Added
- added `assurance/assurance-lifecycle-event.schema.json` as the portable Stack contract for change detection, reassessment, invalidation, supersession, provenance, authority, and bounded reassessment scope;
- added machine-verifiable material, non-material, and unknown-impact handling with fail-safe lifecycle dispositions;
- added lifecycle validation and negative probes preventing material or unknown impact from silently preserving current assurance.

### Interoperability evidence
- demonstrated TSPP production of the shared lifecycle event while retaining security/privacy posture materiality authority;
- demonstrated CTS consumption for bounded-versus-full conformance reassessment without reclassifying upstream materiality;
- demonstrated Assurance Hub recomposition of current assurance validity without rewriting historical outcomes or stealing upstream semantic authority.

### Governance
- preserved TSMM canonical semantic authority and explicit `authorityTransfer: false` bindings;
- promoted the lifecycle event into the TSMS golden-path contract set only after cross-repository consumption succeeded;
- recorded that v0.15.0 is additive and evidence-driven rather than a synchronization-only release.

## v0.14.1 - 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- repaired GitHub Pages link generation and publication-surface validation;
- removed raw repository Markdown from the deployed Pages artifact;
- removed the npm package-install dependency from candidate validation.

### Governance
- established TIS Core admission criteria and separated normative core contracts from ecosystem adapters and repository assurance evidence.


## [v0.14.0] - 2026-08-20

### Changed
- Align the DTG Witness Credential overlay with the merged DTG credential specification: `taskContext` and a JCS/SHA-256 VRC `digest` now provide exchange and exact-edge binding.
- Refresh DTG upstream compatibility tracking across credential, Trust Task, ZKP, and implementation repositories.
- Reduce npm validation dependencies to Ajv only, move CI to Node 22 LTS, disable lifecycle scripts, prefer the npm cache, and bound registry retry delays.

### Documentation and publication
- Add a complete schema catalog and a dated DTG upstream review to GitHub Pages.
- Add generated-site completeness validation so every `docs/**/*.md` source must produce an HTML page before deployment.

### Assurance
- Treat unmerged VDC and proof-of-liveness work as tracked drift rather than silently promoting proposal semantics into TIS.


## [v0.13.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- Stable TSMM semantic traceability using `urn:tsmm:concept:*` identifiers.
- Machine-readable TSMM semantic coverage and schema-level `x-tsmm-semantic-binding` metadata.
- Portable portfolio relationship, repository authority, adoption path, and validation-result schemas.
- Repository-local portfolio relationship and TSMM compatibility contracts.
- CI checks for semantic alignment, authority transfer violations, mapped artifact existence, and version drift.
- Task-oriented GitHub Pages navigation across Artifact Contracts, Semantic Alignment, Assurance & Validation, Integration & Adoption, Governance & Lifecycle, and Releases.
- Executable GitHub Pages information-architecture validation through `tools/validate-pages-ia.js`.


### CI and publication
- Remove the unused npm Mermaid package; Mermaid validation remains Python-based.
- Reduce the npm lockfile dependency surface from 168 package entries to 28.
- Run `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` with an explicit lockfile cache key.
- Expand `candidate:check` to include governance, portfolio relationships, semantic alignment, version consistency, documentation, Pages IA, Mermaid validation, and candidate evidence generation.

### Governance
- Preserve TSMM authority over canonical semantics, TIS authority over portable schema contracts, and portfolio-repository authority over classification.

## Unreleased

- Establish flagship authority, adoption, assurance, interoperability, validation-evidence, and GitHub Pages controls without changing the repository version.
